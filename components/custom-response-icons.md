# Response Icons

## Introduction

This functionality leverages the "emotion" functionality in Teneo Studio. 

Just construct your emotions in a format where there a pipe sign \| and the icon name after the pipe sign. Add the emotion to any response node and you should see the custom icon being displayed in the response.

Any icon from here should work.
