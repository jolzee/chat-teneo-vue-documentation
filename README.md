# Quick Start

## Limitations

Leopard in its current form is useful for prototypes and demonstrations. It's designed to float over an Iframed web page.

With a little bit of coding work it's very likely that Leopard could be built as a standard [web component](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) and therefore easily included on web site regardless of the underlying tech.

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vuetify ](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/quick-start)are pretty modern frameworks. Leopard will therefore run fine on Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Chrome and Safari. It will not work in IE 11 or below without adding some coding logic to the build process.

ASR and TTS utilizes the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) through the use of the [Artyom.js](https://sdkcarlos.github.io/sites/artyom.html) library.  You will only reliably be able to use both ASR and TTS in a Chrome Browser.
