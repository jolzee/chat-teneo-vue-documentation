# Quick Start

## Introduction

Leopard can be used for demonstrations, prototypes and in production. In non-embed mode the chat client is designed to float over an Iframed web page. 

It can also be embedded on an external site. 

## Limitations

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vuetify ](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/quick-start)are modern frameworks. Leopard will therefore run fine on Microsoft Edge, Opera, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and IE 11.

ASR and TTS utilizes the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) through the use of the [Artyom.js](https://sdkcarlos.github.io/sites/artyom.html) library.  You will only reliably be able to use both ASR and TTS in a Chrome Browser.
